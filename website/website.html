    <br><p>As computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, in this digital age it is impossible to not be surrounded by thousands of computing-like-devices, it is all around us. The digital age and advancements in technology has brought both benefits and drawbacks to modern day society. As more and more people are drawn into this digital age, the likelihood of misuse and ethical issues arise, especially with the upcoming and widely used artificial intelligence. I hope this website can make you question, reflect and engage in a more positive society where technology is used for the betterment of humanity.</p></br>
